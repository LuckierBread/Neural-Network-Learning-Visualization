# Neural-Network-Learning-Visualization 
This project will be an exploration of how a machine learning algorithm learns new subjects.
We will split this into 3 sections. 
## 1. Individual Subject Learning
In this section, we will explore what it looks like for a simple neural network to approximate a single example

## 2. Multi-Example Subject Learning
In this section we will explore what it looks like for a simple neural network to approximate a subject based on multiple examples 

## 3. Multi-Example Multi-Subject Learning
Here we will explore how an algorithm learns how to distinguish subjects based on a training set of ~21,000 images
